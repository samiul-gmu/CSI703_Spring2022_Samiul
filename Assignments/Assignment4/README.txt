This figure is a snapshot of a visualization framework that I designed as a part of the covid data visualization framework.

The feedback I received:

Feedback to Learner 
A)Someone could be biased by challenging "what counts as a covid-19 death" or 
someone who challenges the validity in the data. 

B) I believe if someone was Red/Green colorblind they could miss the significance of the graph with multiple colors. 
I think adding some texture would help. 

C) I think that he used the Gestalt Principle, Pre-attentive Processing Attributes (Size) 
to show significance in this visualization. Using this principle, the visualization teaches me 
how the covid-19 virus has impacted Africa, Europe, and Southern Asia.
